# Using Data Mining for Weather Prediction
This is the coursework project for CS-C3160 Data Science

Data mining is a computer assisted process of digging through large sets of data and analyzing it. Data mining
techniques enables us to predict behaviours and trends which can be used by companies to make proactive
decisions. Data mining can help us to predict meteorological data that is weather prediction. Weather prediction has a vital application in meteorology and it has been a challenging problem since the past century. Weather forecasting is the use of science and technology to predict the condition of weather. This project aims to estimate the weather by using predictive analysis. For this it is necessary to use different data-mining techniques to get the most accurate estimate. This project introduces a classifier approach for prediction of weather condition and shows how techniques like PCA, linear regression and binary classification model can be utilized for the prediction purpose.
